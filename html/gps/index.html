      <h2>Release 2: Add meaningful semantic tags to the document</h2>
      <p>Discussed with my pair and guide the definitions and purpose of the various tags provided and how to best use them in practice.</p>

      <h2>Release 3: Create a Table</h2>
      <p> Created a table with 3 rows and 3 columns and 1 colspan</p>
      <table border="1">
        <tr>
          <th>Name1</th>
          <th>Name2</th>
          <th>Name3</th>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td rowspan="2">cell 1</td>
          <td>cell 2</td>
          <td>cell 3</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>cell 4</td>

      <p><b>What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?</b></p>
      <p>The use of HTML5 semantic tags helps to better organize the content inside of an HTML document, as well as in providing more enhanced associated meaning to the various elements used in its structure. Using semantic tags to suggest the purpose and role of the content enclosed within an HTML tag improves the automated processing of documents from screen-readers, parsers and search engines. I find tags used for 'sectioning' purposes like the header and footer, nav and section tags the most useful as they help to better organize code by indicating the purpose of each element or code block inside the HTMl doc.</p>

      <p><b>What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?</b></p>
      <p>The browser usually displays the elements on a page in the same order they are defined. It parses the HTML structure as a tree so execution happens from top to bottom -the first elements will load first and the last elements will load last. Some browsers for example Firefox vs Chrome may load some particular elements in a different sequence trying to optimize for performance but in general the HTML document gets parsed into a tree and read from top to bottom.</p>

      <p><b>What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more snippets at a later date?</b></p>
      <p>I really liked the snippet functionality in Sublime. I'm starting to realize that Sublime has a lot more flexibility than i am aware of and I'm excited to start playing around with it and discover what else is there that will be useful to take advantage of as i progress in my learning.</p>
      <p>Snippets are nice and i think they can be very useful to an experienced developer as they can help increase the speed of development by saving unnecessary and repetitive typing. I'm looking forward to incorporating them more in my work as i get more comfortable with my learning, but for now i think I'll benefit more from not relying on them and instead practice typing everything out and learning some more sublime shortcuts.</p>

      <p><b>What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?</b></p>
      <p>I really did not find anything particularly difficult from this challenge. Some new material was introduced here i.e. learning how to create the snippets in Sublime which i intend to look up a bit more and practice creating and working with them but other than that in general i think the main thing for me at this point is practicing my GitHub and Git workflows to get more comfortable in executing the appropriate actions as needed.</p>
