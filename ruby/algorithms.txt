Release 0: Algorithm for using an Elevator:

- Enter Elevator
- Select the required floor number and press the button with the number corresponding for that floor
- Elevator doors close
- Start the elevator counter on the current floor number 
    - For each number in a list of floor numbers:
        -if current floor number is > required floor number
            - subtract required floor number from current floor number and store (the absolute value) of the result (outcome)
            - elevator moves downwards one floor at a time, x times (x = the result of the above expression)
        - otherwise if current floor number is < required floor number
            - subtract required floor number from current floor number and store (the absolute value) of the result (outcome)
            - elevator moves upwards one floor at a time, x times (x = the result of the above expression)
- When current floor number equals required floor number
    - elevator stops moving
    - elevator doors open
