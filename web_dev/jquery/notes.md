# Learning jQuery

## Plan:
* Find 2-3 good resources to use for beginners in jQuery (could be articles, brief tutorials etc.)
* Find a jQuery cheat-sheet to bookmark for reference
* Find and bookmark jQuery documentation 


## Study Notes:
* I found a couple of brief tutorials to watch that i felt did a good job giving an overview of jQuery and how it can be used
* Going over a few articles and blog posts on some of the functionality of jQuery was also helpful to get an idea of what's there to use and how to use it
* Bookmarked 1-2 cheatsheets that i plan to use as a reference in the future
